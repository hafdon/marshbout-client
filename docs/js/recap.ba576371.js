Stay wove, everyone</h1>\n<p><em>February 22, 2020</em><br><em>Day 7</em></p>\n<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>\n<p>Before bedding down for the night, Flick pressed Isabella and Lupenna on the true purpose of their plan to disguise Isabella as Lupenna while the latter skipped from plane to plane to catch Tantegorisch. They demurred slightly when considering the arrangement in retrospect, but Isabella remained convinced that she couldn&#39;t have tended the castle in her true form without causing terror amongst the townsfolk. Flick retired rather than adumbrate a detailed genealogy with her godmother and half-aunt, and the gang awoke the next morning to delicious stacked pancakes and an invitation to assist Isabella with research into Boggshosh, the elder god. Drav and Paros, delighted by the offer, perused old tomes with Carlos at the ready in case of overexertion. Drav, ever in command of her faculties, discovered texts on the ancient rituals of Boggshuosh cultists and a loose leaf from a memoir concerning Sirmgalv, a quasi-mythological world-tree. Paros, lost in contemplation, was Veenock&#39;ed around and put in mind of a primeval rivalry between the evil spirit and the demon Nundocamar; he was further tasked with the recovery of an onyx ring with great psionic powers.</p>\n<p>Flick and Joan, meanwhile, took advantage of the crisp fall air and trekked to the North Tower, which they discovered to be more of a waystation for happenstansical travelers. Flick immediately ransacked the workshed and pilfered a pair of sealskin gloves and an unexpectedly strong rope woven out of fizzlecyst silk. Joan, convinced the tower housed eggs in need of protection, attempted to open the door from the downside up, and in so doing alerted the resident, Hale Clotwool, who introduced herself as a herder. Greeted also by the music inside (<em>Straight out the butte: never gonna&#39; plateau</em>, by The Young Fustics), the smells of a rich second breakfast, and the inquisitive head of a laid-up turr named Orbell Daedonbashur, Joan and Flick assisted in repairing the door and casing the joint. Flick&#39;s heightened conusance of portalian japery, however, shattered the placid free-for-all and brought her face to face with an avatar of Juniper Three School; together they inferred that the reddish-gold ingots were somehow altering the planar coherence around Egg Three School.</p>\n<p>By early afternoon everyone had reconvened at Castle Karn, just in time to witness an efflorescent belch of petals aflame exploding from Tobolux&#39;s berninde. It took Paros&#39;s increasingly worrisome familiarity with Veenock to make an assay at the truth: demonic BaphOMO got sloppy attempting to influence the current cosmological detente on Thuslubber[^thuslubber] and killed some &#39;weak and tasty&#39; <em>bloemenwet</em>. Domonkos and Lupenna, unbothered by the general goings-on, began to draft up the details for an immortal castle timeshare, and the group headed towards <em>An Sráidbhaile</em>. It quickly became necessary to implement &#39;ghost fog protocol,&#39; involving, in part, mental exercises to prevent subconscious resentment of people considered mediocre; but, even perceptive Flick was taken unawares upon stumbling into Grenlich&#39;s immor. As Joan rushed forward to embrace the future of humanoid-manity, the other adventurers did what they could to injure the poor unfortunate gnoll, in pain, in need.</p>\n<h2 id="début">Début</h2>\n<p>[^thuslubber]: The isthmus which encloses Snaff Bay west of Marshbout.</p>\n'},"56a9":function(e,t){e.exports='<h1 id="001-marshboutwards">001. Marshboutwards</h1>\n<p><em>September 21, 2019</em><br><em>Day 1</em></p>\n<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>\n<p>In the city of Cressida, wood elf Flick approached Remy Flitch, a well-known crew leader, for information about an enigmatic artifact she’d been carrying with her since adoption. Remy’s thaumaturge Snav, after inspecting the artifact, grotesquely directed her to one ‘Lupenna’ near the town of Marshbout. Remy, though annoyed by Flick’s importunity, dispatched Joan — travelling to Marshbout on her own assignment — as a chaperone.</p>\n<p>They both made their way south without issue until their passage over a stone bridge was impeded by a deceptively adorable bearcublike creature sporting a single spiral horn on its forehead. Joan’s attempts to platonically embrace the creature were misinterpreted as aggression, and she allowed herself to be flung to the side so as to spare it any embarrassment. Flick, evincing her trademark uncircumspect insistency, presented the creature with her onyx figurine. The Zorbo, upon touching the object, began to take on its material attributes (for such, as they surmised, is the way of Zorbon), only to be afflicted by something far more powerful, and collapsed. They administered to the cub as best they were able, but only time and physical contact with its fieldstone home could help the cutie, so they proceeded apace to Marshbout.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Drav, a dwarf wizard raised by elves in Forest Ogrelodge, adventured westward to discover kindred dwarven communities. At the foothills of the Steeple Peak Mountains, she was introduced to Carlos the Dwarf, a cleric about to travel to Marshbout to donate his healing expertise to the beleaguered community there.</p>\n<p>They were offered a ride by the stormless cloud giant Rufus Skyflume. After a day in his makeshift wagon surrounded by longhaired cloud cattle and a shorthaired favorite named Priscilla, they parted ways at Balach Pass when Rufus headed north to visit a family member. What should have been a half-a-day’s march to town elongated somewhat when they passed by Mirror Lake, whose strange magic required that they swap some possessions before escaping its spatio-temporal loop. They arrived in Marshbout later that afternoon, and, while making their way to the Perch Office to send messenger owls with letters of safe arrival to their families, Drav sighted an enormous cat. When they inquired of the loquacious Perchmaster General as to any events or conditions requiring clerical ministration, he mentioned a few instances of exploding bodies and zombified cats, but could not comment as to the ‘pig-sized’ feline of Drav’s report. He was able to point them towards Norman Barrelchest, one of the town’s constables (in charge of the armamentarium and responsible for ensuring the safety of the nearby highways).</p>\n'},"65bc":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var o=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("b-container",e._l(e.recaps,(function(t,o){return a("b-card",{key:o,attrs:{"no-body":""},scopedSlots:e._u([{key:"header",fn:function(){return[a("h4",[e._v("Session "+e._s(o))])]},proxy:!0}],null,!0)},[a("b-card-body",[a("div",{staticClass:"text-left",domProps:{innerHTML:e._s(t)}})])],1)})),1)},n=[],r=a("56a9"),i=a.n(r),s=a("02d1"),h=a.n(s),d={data:function(){return{recaps:[i.a,h.a]}}},l=d,c=a("2877"),u=Object(c["a"])(l,o,n,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=u.exports}}]);
