## Recap

In the city of Cressida, wood elf Flick approached Remy Flitch, a well-known crew leader, for information about an enigmatic artifact she’d been carrying with her since adoption. Remy’s thaumaturge Snav, after inspecting the artifact, grotesquely directed her to one ‘Lupenna’ near the town of Marshbout. Remy, though annoyed by Flick’s importunity, dispatched Joan — travelling to Marshbout on her own assignment — as a chaperone.

They both made their way south without issue until their passage over a stone bridge was impeded by a deceptively adorable bearcublike creature sporting a single spiral horn on its forehead. Joan’s attempts to platonically embrace the creature were misinterpreted as aggression, and she allowed herself to be flung to the side so as to spare it any embarrassment. Flick, evincing her trademark uncircumspect insistency, presented the creature with her onyx figurine. The Zorbo, upon touching the object, began to take on its material attributes (for such, as they surmised, is the way of Zorbon), only to be afflicted by something far more powerful, and collapsed. They administered to the cub as best they were able, but only time and physical contact with its fieldstone home could help the cutie, so they proceeded apace to Marshbout.

Meanwhile, Drav, a dwarf wizard raised by elves in Forest Ogrelodge, adventured westward to discover kindred dwarven communities. At the foothills of the Steeple Peak Mountains, she was introduced to Carlos the Dwarf, a cleric about to travel to Marshbout to donate his healing expertise to the beleaguered community there.

They were offered a ride by the stormless cloud giant Rufus Skyflume. After a day in his makeshift wagon surrounded by longhaired cloud cattle and a shorthaired favorite named Priscilla, they parted ways at Balach Pass when Rufus headed north to visit a family member. What should have been a half-a-day’s march to town elongated somewhat when they passed by Mirror Lake, whose strange magic required that they swap some possessions before escaping its spatio-temporal loop. They arrived in Marshbout later that afternoon, and, while making their way to the Perch Office to send messenger owls with letters of safe arrival to their families, Drav sighted an enormous cat. When they inquired of the loquacious Perchmaster General as to any events or conditions requiring clerical ministration, he mentioned a few instances of exploding bodies and zombified cats, but could not comment as to the ‘pig-sized’ feline of Drav’s report. He was able to point them towards Norman Barrelchest, one of the town’s constables (in charge of the armamentarium and responsible for ensuring the safety of the nearby highways).
