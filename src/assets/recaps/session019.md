## Recap

#### Curculio

Flick, Carlos and Joan returned to _An Sráidbhaile_ with Thaz in order to plead with the gnolls to accept her back into their clan. Meanwhile, Curculio approached Drav, Fez and Paros about a message she had been sent by her friend Wodden just after escaping the confines of a magic lake. Curculio, after sizing up Turtle's gastronomical potential, and describing her home cuisine of _schilpad stoofpot_ or turtle-and-rosepetal stew made customarily from auroch-bladder-sized turtles found in seaside collections of nearly frictionless stones sliding back and forth with the tide along thin trenches. Fez declared himself "His Seaness" -- a necessary ego boost before the kitsune maligned a halfling language orthography for consisting of only "bowls and sticks." Fez was put in mind of Doodril Frogwart's _Bowls and Sticks: a Confusing language for a Charming people; an Abecedarium or alphabetical Primer_ published through Doodle's Toodles, an imprint of Frogwart's primary publisher for young readers. Curculio mentioned Doodril Frogwart's Secular Healing Clinic in Marshbout, the not unsuspicious vanguard of a series of similar clinics popping up in the major cities, and the primary distributor of the _Secular Ministrations_ which Paros lifted from the Castle Karn library. Drav was able to confirm that Frogwart was not only prolific, but prolithic, as he had penned a few flimflammminy articles on healing crystals. Paros unsuccessfully attempted to recall the method for extracting malt sugar (maltose) from barley, disappearing into one of his familiar reveries and dreaming about the fancypencils he used at the castle.

Curculio had a rough idea as to location the lake; specifically, playful flowerfolk were known to follow its bittersweet magic and could serve as guides. Fez, still determined to save the face of his people, declared that "in our world, flowers are the children's money." Paros expressed concern Baphomet posed a serious threat to the flowerfolk. Fez, mishearing Baphomet as "Bear Vomit," unknowlingly foreshadowed a future party encounter. Paros went on to insult human-fox news, and admitted that his own news came from the psychic manifestation of an evil entity known as Veenock. Curculio mentioned another friend of hers, Zadee (a competent _verb runt_ [^verb runt], which Fez believed unlikely until told of the logically rigorous 63-letter alphabet employed by many canids.

Curculio mentions a race of beings known as "damonts."

#### The ghost in the woods

Proceeding through the forest, the group came across a seemingly innocuous ghost trapped in what appears to be an evolving maze that affects only itself. When Fez approaches, he's recognized by the spirit, which resolves into Cpt. Merrigold. Juna reveals that the death of Von Veen released her from her piscine hybrid form, but before she could terminate her postmortem journey she was redirected into a limitless maze. With Baphomet's influence in play, Drav thought it highly likely that an entity enjoying a boon of Baphomet could encase people or spirits in these demiplanar mazes and siphon life energy from them.

As Fez retreated into the woods to clear his head and bladder, Paros, Curculio, and Drav conceived a notion to use Turtle merely as a catalyst and seasoning for a "turtle bath stew." Informing Fez of this upon his return, the overconfident halfling opined on the fox fur stew so favored by halfling-kind. Curculio slashed Fez across the face for this insult, interjecting that her mother had died in the Foxpelt Wars, but then apologized when Fez clarified that the fur in the stew was merely shorn from willing foxes rather than made of their pelts. Paros forgot the difference between the words "hasty" and "tasty" before trying to work out with Fez the mathematics of a hypothesized interdimensional snail for which every journey was "an hour and 50 miles."

### Tusternoof

At that point, the gang witnessed Juna's form torn apart like curtains being drawn as an entish creature with a motile deerskull for a head, vines and leaves streaming off its body like a tattered cloak, stepped through the opening. Announcing itself as "Tusternoof" or "The twisted one," it attempted to imprison the adventurers in mazes like that restraining Juna. After a debate on the competing merits of halfing, grenlich, and tusternoofian land husbandry, The twisted one provided a possible clue to locating the mirror lake. Paros, realizing the unmined potential of Tusternoof's knowledge, sank deep into its mind as Fez found himself sucked into a mindmaze. Tusternoof unwittingly revealed the 'org chart' of Baphomet's followers (of which he confirmed himself a boon'd lieutenant), including a shadowy cult of _urush mekh_ like himself handling instricate metalwork skullcaps made of a reddish-gold alloy.

Fez harnessed the incredible power of his mind-thoughts and collapsed the carceral psychic construct, appearing back on the material plan in a series of thin slices which coalesced into his physical form -- an event which would certainly not have any future effect on him. Paros summarily defeated Tusternoof with a well-placed blob of pure elemental energy.

#### Flowerfolk

With the monster dead, the forest began to come to life once again, and Fez was drawn to a member of the Flowerfolk (or _bloemenwet_) in a nearby tree. The creature, whose name was Ashtai, resembled a domestic rabbit comprised entirely of pale red and violet flower petals, and declared itself in the midst of its vacation. Paros shattered the tranquility of its aestivation by warning Ashtai of Baphomet's plans to absorb the power of the Flowerfolk. Using Ashtai as a signal booster, Paros used his bracer to telepathically premonish the bloemenwet on the Slubber, but received nothing but visions of holocaust in return. Unsure as to whether this was an oracle or had already transpired, Paros communicated his anxiety to the party. Drav recalled reading a colloquiae conducted by dwarven geomancers concerning the Slubber: an ancient earth spirit, Mogesh, was reputed to guard and protect the area, and perhaps could be convinced to extend that aegis to the bloemenwet. The group pondered what step to take next.
