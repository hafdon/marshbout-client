## notes taken while playing

fez: whip, rapier, fish-scale mail
drav: dwarf looked like raised by elves; long luxurious beard and hair with twigs and flowers; quarterstaff with carved-like-Tulip on the end. 
  - flowerfolk ?

jean-luc: the crime syndicate that's after you lost you in marshbout, and you've been hiding out in the forest for a week trying to lose the tail. 
- JL trying to move quickly without being detected
- tied a broom to the back of his belt to erase tracks, and it's making things worse (so ... how is it that they haven't found him?)
- JL sees drav, fez, turtle from 80 feet away 
- sees drav, super-beefy bustling wizard
- doesn't see flick, who's up in the trees
- JL: these folks are not after you
  - crouched low, looking "through" underbrush

jean luc: black cape; leather with unnecessary buckles; long blonde hair; 5'o'clock shadow; in woods for a week; rapier ("Lydia") in cursive

jean luc and fez recognize kindred spirits in being over-confident
jean luc lives life to the fullest; and fez also doesn't mind

dk: over-estimate own charmingness
- mushroom capsules made of sinews
- attacked by dog made partly of plant growth; dispatched it but it knocked him down and briefly passed out and had a vision of huge john-carpenter wolf merged with the thing ravaging an area, ripping heads off bodies; raging out of control; pure cannibalistic hunger and violence (Shogal). 

mick: tell me your views on life cycles and fungus

jean-luc: lying; you sleep with the wrong guy's wife.
I needed to get out of town.
and jean-luc has a short-bow
flick: 5'2", leather armor worse for wear; bow, shield, rapier

jean-luc not anxious about joining another crew. 
on the sleigh is also paros. 
jean-luc looking to left of flick and saying he knew flick was there the whole time. 
jean-luc ... something ... the sword (didn't drop it on the ground) 
jean-luc says that ... the druids?? are known card players ?

- Drav is the most capable seeming member of the party. (pushing trees aside; picking up large rocks to examine them and throwing them behind her.)
stonehenge-sized benches lining a circular area. they protrude up occasionally. 
something hanging from the trees on the edge of the circular. 
- dark-blue zaps of light. they flit from spot to spot on the ground. 
- heat-mirage in the middle of the circle. 
- stone is not native to the area. it was lava (larval rock) that became stone. from cooling larval rock from giant rock worm. 
- rocks are reflecting light on insight from whatever's creating heat mirage. 100 ft. distant at this point. 

- zaps up next to jean-luc, dark-blue/purple creature, 1 foot high, devoid of hair, large head, large yellow eyes, big hands and feet; looks like a small twisted humanoid; very small gnome. 
- strikes as fey/sylvan creature. wearing a velvet suit and cravat. 
  - come in and join us! wrestling competition going on. 

- the rocks are like very tall benches; 
- pieces of flesh hanging from trees; little boggle aristocrats blipping in and out. 
- zilsz did say they were "evil druids" (did she?)
{compare to quicklings -- whole body has been shaped by moving quickly} 

- Aule puts magical religious insulation between Carlos's chain mail "let's get up there". carlos and flick are stealthing
- jean-luc being taken in
- boggles flitting around
- humanoid druids are in there. 
  - stark-naked, and shiny because covered in oil; a bunch of strigils around to scrape off the oil
  - 3 groups of 2 (6) wrestling
  - other 6 are dippingi shallow metal bowl/mugs into bubbling cauldrons and drinking. 
  - the cauldrons are the fey creature's money. 

- somehow full desiccated genitals hanging from the trees. 
[what are the druids trying to do]
- hung there liminally; the ritual space between the wrestling and the forest. 

- carlos is convinced that turtle can breathe out its butt

... something about cases of sandcrabs?
- very old, thick trees; no one notices someone climbing
- boggle talking jean-luc into wrestling
  - boggle hands jean-luc a tree-bark pamphlet on druidic wrestling. "druidic wrestling in thubudder. what you need to know to be safe"

## i draw the map of the wrestling center (100X70 ft)  
- seems like they are a little drunk
- wrestling with a bit of slap&tickle. 
- jean-luc wrestled in high school.

druid: hardly anything we do but wrestle, have a good time, drink deeply of the bubbling puddles. it looks like you've been eying that pamphlet. do you have any interest participating in the wrestling? Eltaeor. 

Unicorn shows up at his whistle. 
  - this one has horn which is a dirty orange color; orange coalescing around a rusty screw or washer; whatever is bubbling in the pits is oozing out of its horn, and creating its mane -- oozing orange liquid. also oozing out of its chin to form thin whispy unicorn beard. the rest of its coat is a deep green. 

Eltaeor: this is Exuviae Whiffinger. She is our patron deity here. Facilitates most of what goes on at the circle. -- she! i always get that wrong. 
  - the first step is to remove one's clothing. - wearing a sumo diaper ("mawashi")
  - he kneels, and exuvia puts her horn against his forehead, and the grease cascades down over his body. eltaeor gets a glazed look in his eye and looks happy.
  - (presumably this is more potent than the stuff in the pits?)
  - flick vomits up in the tree looking at this. 

- jean-luc: (i'm missing this part of convo)
Unicorn? : Slime? what slime to you refer to?
  - the oil is the primary lubricant for being welcomed into the atmosphere of this area. 
  - glucuprion will show you how to put the diaper on.
(acoustics: everything magnified in volume)
  - take your clothes off and I'll wrap this cloth around you; doesn't look like he can do it because he's so short. 
  - tie son with a [13]

Paros wakes up around now.
eltaeor: bow before exuviae and think happy thoughts of the motherland 
  - jean-luc CON check
  - STR mod +2; dex mod +2
  - everything except eltaeor is grey and distant, but he's burning with this holy energy
  - oil came out in cottage cheese clumps (and they strigil each other) -- hear it as a godly reverberative command
  - elthaeor: you are quite a match for me! where did you train (i switched eltaeor's voice)

dimpleweed academy -- martial attitude was where jean-luc trained. 
(the Dimpleweed in Cressida probably)
maeve goozby and monks

- should try swordfighting, too!

JL wrestled one bout with eltaeor. vision . plato's description of shadows in cave.  light of eltaeor fades; greyness; then form of unicorn comes up, and shining like eltaeor was; 

unicorn trapped in circle of people whose genitals are shining; and unicorn bows deeply, and all the heads of the creatures are severed, and gouts of blood 
  - then he comes back to himself; and he's been pinned to the ground by eltaeor. 

- i see all sorts of stuff while wrestling; usually visions have connection to deeper source of power
- jean-luc says he has to go
- might be difficult to leave while still under effects of oil

1st step is 2 movement, then 4, then 8
8 total steps (feet)
- from far distance: eltaeor: if you come back i can make it a little easier to leave
- glucuprion: he's telling the truth
- DM: you don't think either one is trying to kill you. 
- eltaeor starts telling JL about unicorns. (ounicourns)
  - people think that unicorns can be calmed by virgins; we have a relationship with exuviae -- i'm going to need to take an imprint of your genitals. 
  - we don't remove them, we just need a mould! it helps to corral exuviae. 
 -  jean-luc looks like dragging himself through thick, thick air

flick: this runic circle is not a portal; but the infinitude of boggles inside are creating teleportation jumps; like quantum soup; constantly bubbling up. so many portals it looks like the whole space is seething. 
Aule: magic; detects that genital imprint made on fabric of reality, then space opens up in circumference of circle; i just want to help you kill undead. 
  - does a huge bong hit and passes out

- jean-luc looks like attached to rubber band
- fez rides turtle up; met by another boggle - are you coming to join jean-luc?
- flick still up a tree
- carlos around
- fez in the lower left
- fez is the face
- boggle: "exuviae is the master of the circle"
  - let's get you right in there. 
  - how do you want the lighting when you come in? a dirge? 
SCROBS the boggle, blinks back to circle, 
- detailing how the druids are lining up
- able to get to jean-luc. druids picked up pan flutes and playingtaps and mozart's requiem on them. 

- fez challenges the strongest fighter, dealla
- beefy lady druid: "what do you mean, horse face"
  - masticating / masturbating equine
  - carlos: it works either way
  - "of the unicorn's generals"
- fight on behalf of exuviae
  - fez: how are you going to fight two halves of X, which is the whole exuviae
- fez: "it's an all-clothes on cage match"
- druids huddle up; discussing fighting with clothes on
- drav throws a fireball. 
- all huddled up, and dealla comes back out: yeah, we can arrange something, full costume. 
dealla holds out horsepill-sized vitamin looks like it's made from calcified orange oil. 
flick: "do not swallow that"
- fez: i gargle salt-water.
  - but get some kind of prismatic spray on it.

MCW "marshbout championship wrestling" 
MWE marshbout wrestling entertainment

flick is going over to jean-luc
  - drops down to inspect him to see if there's a forcefield. 
  - roll an arcana or religion check [14]
  - the way his body thinks it can move (but there's also the thick air around it)
  - flick tries to drunk-walk jean-luc away at half movement speed. 
  - JL takes 5 points of psychic damage; and each round he can make DC15 con saving throw
  - flick takes him back to a tree; away from the circle

## rolling initiative for the fight

- rolling about activates the oil; staying still will calm it; doesn't have bright light effect that he was seeing before (adv. on con save)
- boggles have constructed a shelf in one of the benches; 
- Fez the Mez, alright; taps are playing. 
- fez lets out spray of water. 
  - boggles quantum activity interacts with salt water that it shoots out turquoise prismatic spray. 
  - mostly the druids and the boggles. 

- fez takes 15 poison damage. , and they all take half. 
- the pamphlet is made of bark; won't hold up to poison spray
- then drav: fireball
- boggles disappear; flick isn't getting static anymore. 
- all 6 druids take full 30 damage. disgusting smelling smoke starts pouring off their bodies.  -- killed 6 of them
- druids "alex mack" back into exuviae -- what; how are they doing this. 
- [[{{horse noise}}]] -- no druids visible.  --- transforms into bojack horseman type
- carlos: are we going to get a molding of exuviae's anatomy. 
  - super-ripped human with hooves for hands, and a unicorn horn
- then carlos turn: 
  - spiritual hammer: exuviae taps way around. 
  - "plenty of druids in the unicorn stand" ??? carlos / jake (there's always money in the bananastand)
  - exuviae goes to smash with fist hoove

scrobs as ring announceer -- now wearing a top-hat and using a massive genital as a pull-down microphone. made of metal with perforations around it. 

flick doing a shitload of damage
paros chromatic orb @ second level
- drav ? fez? is

- exuviae: try and get me now -- casts a shield on itself. AC is now 20
they don't call me "ah, oh, nevermind"

dressage: with the relevant effects
unicorn not hurt at poison spray

scrobs continues announcing. 
- fez takes a million bludgeoning damage from exuviae

carlos casts a mcregular

am I doing an fez the mez voice for ... aule ? who is this? 
-- this should be fake aule. "get back in the training ring"
