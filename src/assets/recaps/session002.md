## Recap

Having brought Flick safely to the Marshbout town limits, Joan shepherded her to the armory near the northeast watchtower. They were about to meet-cute Drav and Carlos at the entranceway when an agitated and aggrieved band of five humans pushed their way past and into the building. Carlos stood by disinterestedly (almost as though he were an entirely different person than earlier that day) while the contact he had been sent to talk to, Norman Barrelchest (one of the armory’s constables) attempted to impress upon this furious group his social superiority through enigmatic gesticulations and the distinct absence of suspenders (traditionally associated, in Marshbout, with the gentry). He was nevertheless pulled in their wake back up Plumb Highway (so called because of how straight it is, aka SCBOHSIT or “skee boh sit”) to the scene of some annoyance. Carlos dolly-zoomed in on a medical supply cabinet at the end of the infirmary as his kleptomania took hold. After some hijinks, Joan was able to thrust herself in the mix and come up with some much-vaunted suppositories and also a minor potion of healing (2d4+4 hp, 1 action), which she delivered forthwith to Carlos.

Flick, too, took full advantage of this opportunity to secure the attention of Darlyle (looking a bit overworked) and Rik Sandstone (looking a bit overdressed), the two medics. They were able to do what Carlos, in his infinite sadness, had been unable to accomplish; -- namely, point Flick to Lupenna’s likely whereabouts in the visinage of Castle Karn on the Grey Tongue. Flick was not slow to point out Carlos’s relative inadequacy, thus igniting the powerful cleric’s deep-seated rage and commencing what would surely become one of the great rivalries the continent, nay, the world! had ever known.

Despite this newly minted drama, the four began the five-mile trek to the Tongue. With confidence at its peak, they were enjoying the plush tranquility of Thubutter Farest when they were set upon by three plant-dogs affected by an inky evil seeping out of their eye sockets. The dogs, begging to be 'weeded', 'lawn'ched themselves at the travellers. Though the dogs were handily dispatched (all of whom exploded into clouds of ash upon death), Carlos was injured and laid flat during the fight. He was taken by a brief fit during which he suffered an ominous vision of a tunnel deep within the earth and a shapeless void moving towards him. However, perceiving that Carlos was not dead, Flick loudly boasted about her martial superiority, and the adventurers considered their options.
