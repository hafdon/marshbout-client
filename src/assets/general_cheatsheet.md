## 5e.tools

[adventure introduction table](https://5e.tools/tables.html#find%20the%20ideal%20introduction%3b%20adventure%20introduction_dmg)

## improvising a location

### include

- levels (floor and either higher, lower, or both)
- places to hide
  - an idea of what their "cover" would be (½, ¾, full)
- fragile, mobile, or interactive things
  - e.g. vat of something, something behind glass, wooden barrels, cage, huge oven with door
- different lighting conditions
  - not obscured, lightly obscured, obscured

### don't include

- three identical things for aesthetics if one will do and you don't have plans for the other two

## preparing a location

- first level stuff (description and initial investigation)
- second level stuff (hazards; moderate engagement with enemies and npcs, minor plots)
- third level stuff (major plots and conspiracies; character journeys)
- fourth level stuff (historical layers; geographic layers)

### say yes, (and/but) trust your gut

- include more interactivity rather than less:
  - e.g. the oven has no doors
- wild goosechases
  - e.g. sokka wants to find maggie flood (what's the real goal here?); asks oksana
- consistency
  - e.g. cpt. juna merrigold not affected by purple liquid
  - is there a jail cell in the armory ?
- **make everything their business**
  - e.g. (flick: “i don’t care what conflicts these people are embroiled in”)

## npcs

    real reactions (papa goes to hang out with Ygwaine and emo when moonshine drops the bomb about nine circles)
    glad that jaina won, because now you have things to learn from her

## give chance for loot

    (might be sub category)
    if someone asks "is there anything left of … (a dead enemy)"
    give items positive and negative, make positive natural (rather than a "wanting" game mechanic) - +2 sword, but cursed; or, sentimental (Erlin's sword for Bev) but plague. Also -- is positive even true (is it even Erlin's sword)

## give them something during a spontaneous investigation

    if a character says: "I want to sneak around and case the joint," put something there for them to see. Make it worrisome or attractive in keeping with the perception DC that they end up making.
    PRINCIPLE: Make the roll determine the quality of the experience, not the binary success of the experience
    more secret doors/tunnels/places to go

## monsters

- give them investigatable weaknesses and all-parts-of-the-buffalo
- If you make an offering of meat and a successful DC 13 Charisma ability check, the roggenwolf will give you information about nearby locations and prey, including whatever it has seen within the past day. You might be able to persuade a roggenwolf to attack a particular creature or howl at a particular location, at the GM's discretion.
- let monsters body parts be cannibalized, like the cave fish and carrion crawler
- vulnerabilities, resistances, immunities, etc.
- modify the creatures so their attacks change the tactics of a battle (like murph did with the jubilex and its surround-incapacitate-absorb) or whatever
- **let them talk to everyone, including mogh**
- chain of values e.g. fix sister’s situation > eliminate evil urges > find a community > return to full human
- when i'm being an NPC, have answers to "Detect thoughts" questions : surface thoughts, emotions, deeper reasonings & motivations
- build researchable vulnerabilities in (drav: i'm hoping it's vulnerable to fire)
  - allow them to research these things

### villains

- have villains competing, so they are both using the characters against each other but don't care about the characters
- be mean (reincarnate lets death hijack into gunther) -- also Murph's reaction to taking stakes out of campaign (but don't go bullshit -- like red is borderline kill offscreen) -- also get them involved in horsemen (make them scarier)

## dm emotions

- have my own ideas about how characters feel about each other
  - e.g. that's not all it is you guys -- you're friends! (hardwon and moonshine relationship just about wrestling)

## information gathering

- the 'traditional' story of a place/event
- each individual's story (and their motivation for that particular version)
- the "actual" truth
- always have encounters spawn a ton of information
- make a piece of information not-for-sure whenever i can
  - i.e. someone says that x is doing y; (are they right?)

## player characters

- allow characters to redeem themselves: hardwon and stopping an assassination

## building a scenario (cthulhu)

- a mystery or crisis is posed
  - dramatized or offered low key
  - there is always a cause (and thus a conclusion is possible) (even if the situation is stumbled on by chance)
- the investigators become linked to the problem
  - stake in the outcome (money, reputation, friendship, love, pity, charity, suspicion, curiosity)
- investigators attempt to define the mystery
  - look for clues and evidence
  - deal with personalities, overlapping encounters, attacks (depending on length of the thing)
  - most of the descriptions and roleplaying
- investigators use clues and evidence to confront the danger (not necessarily a monster or villain)
  - situation demands their intervention
  - keeper must still make RP rewarding and justify previous effort
- the mystery or problem is solved
  - may conclude the mystery or lead to new problems
  - a gift or acquisition can lead to new adventures

## combat

- Do they like puzzle fights?
  - "we have to disadvantage our way to victory"

## lore

Negotiate the consequence, but let the investigator feel it at least as long as he has the acquisition. For instance, that glistening H&K assault rifle is a more dubious benefit if the previous owner used it to commit an unsolved murder. This sort of consequence easily leads to interesting new episodes of play.

Roleplayers rely on character, not on possessions or powers. Roleplayers experiment with and amuse each other with
made-up personalities. The point of roleplaying is to involve the player characters in dangerous, patriotic, macabre, thrilling, exciting, suspenseful, embarrassing, horrifying, comfortable, curi- ous, shocking, comical, creditable, lusty, insane, dismaying, reward- ing, and stupefying experiences

The quality of such experiences does not depend on numbers, physical simulation, or technical procedure. Roleplaying succeeds by evoking emotions. Their evocation and release is a major reward of the game. That being so, do not leave the emotions out of player responsibilities.
For instance, if a player wants to introduce some new weapon or spell into play, require that the player also supply a correspond- ing risk or a consequence for his investigator, one comparable to the value of the item or power.
Every introduction of a significant purchase or acquisition should have this sort of price. In roleplaying, money means little, but risk is important.

## monster motivation

- find a sanctuary
- conquer the local area
- seek an item
- slay a rival
- hide from enemies
- recover from wounds
- avoid danger
- seek wealth
