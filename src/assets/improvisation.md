## petitioner & granter

### cheatsheet

When a dialogue scene starts, decide if a conflict is actually warranted.  
Find the petitioner and granter.  
Find what the petitioner wants—that’s what the scene is about.  
For an NPC petitioner, pick a starting tactic.  
For an NPC granter, respond to the PC’s starting tactic with a deflecting tactic appropriate to the character and situation.

Keep trading tactics until:

- The petitioner finds one that works
  - End scene with victory for petitioner
- It becomes clear that no tactic will work
  - End scene with loss for petitioner

As in any RPG scene, both failure and success then lead to a new scene that moves the story toward a conclusion.

## notes

### common forms of leverage

- (+) Bargaining: I have something to trade for the thing I want.
- (+) Bribe: Like the above, but underhanded.
- (+) Cause and Effect?: Your life will be easier if you do it (no threat)
- (-) Threat: I’ll make something bad happen to you if you don’t go along. (e.g. actual Blackmail)
- (-) Emotional Blackmail: You’re stuck with me, and I’ll make your life miserable if you don’t give in.
- (-) Emotional Blackmail II: Nobody will ever love you but me.
- ( ) Love: You care about me, so you’ll do this to make me happy.
- ( ) Obligation: You promised you’d help me, and now I’m calling in that debt.
- ( ) Duty: You vowed to help people like me in this situation.
- ( ) Identity: If you do this, you’ll prove you’re the sort of person you think you are.
- ( ) Appearances: If you do this, you’ll seem like the sort of person you profess to be.
- ( ) Approval: If you do this, people will really like you.
- ( ) Respect: I have followed the rules of your social code in asking you this, and those rules say you must grant what I ask.
- ( ) Pleading: I have no other way of persuading you, but I really need this, please, please, please.

### yes and

- accepting an offer (saying “yes”) and building on the offer accepted (adding “and . . .”).
- What you say as the character, and describe about the world and the things in it: these are all offers.

#### on blocking endowments

- **Player Agency**: Don’t use the dice to determine something for a character that the player really doesn’t want to deal with. If she’s blocked the idea that her orc biker has a wife and kids back home, don’t roll dice to make it true. **But try your best to introduce the idea somehow.** For example, roll dice to figure out why somebody got the idea that the biker has a wife and kids back home.
