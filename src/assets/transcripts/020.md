day 8

> recording starts a bit into the actual session

- more gnolls where vegetation is growing out of their body.
- ian does his own description: "i see these thick(?) gnolls laid out like that.

**i need a timeline for thaz**

- flick: when did this start?
- thaz: you saw me the last time i was here
- the grenlich's philosophy is almost going backwards
- flick examines the wound sites. is there a dwoemer going on?

- three from last week came back, left curculio to find the lake, talked thaz back into the village, and take a long rest.
- Flick proficient with hunter's traps
  - "would know how to poison netting"
- Carlos: what toxic property is the blood supposed to have?
- Flick: Acidic
- Arrows made of foxglove pith or ...
- spend an hour to analyze the poison itself; and then combine it with any necessary ingredients.
- i have flick roll with proficiency modifier: [nat 18 + 3 = 21]

> ## crafting and harvesting poison
>
> During downtime between adventures, a character can use the crafting rules in the Player's Handbook to create basic poison if the character has proficiency with a poisoner's kit. At your discretion, the character can craft other kinds of poison. Not all poison ingredients are available for purchase, and tracking down certain ingredients might form the basis of an entire adventure.
> A character can instead attempt to harvest poison from a poisonous creature, such as a snake, wyvern, or carrion crawler. The creature must be incapacitated or dead, and the harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. (Proficiency with the poisoner's kit applies to this check if the character doesn't have proficiency in Nature.) On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature's poison.

- i use rules for poisoner's kit

## hunter's kit

- DC 20: able to handle poison without poisoning yourself
- can determine its effects; to stay on arrowhead and remain potent and not burn into arrowhead, have to let it remain liquid adhesive.
- hours work with successful survival or nature check.
- [12] roll; spent hour fruitlessly looking for that substance.
- goes to find Thaz in Hut of Sadness (bothán brón)
- Flick: "I'm not doing enough damage -- with poison"
- Thaz: yes, you did quite a bit of damage to my once-dead lover
- flick: i'm sorry --- that means you're available tho, right
- Flick: we're hunters, we have fun
- Thaz: I don't know if re-integrating just now, bringing a foreigner in would be acceptable
- Flick: yeah, overton window
- Thaz: mostly use frog and snake poisons; we'll have to be a little more careful with that.
  - will have to do some experimentation while they are out there.
- [roll 19]:
- water postpada: slimy cactus-sap you can combine with the blood; glycerine
  - took all the 2 hours
  - will have to mix with blood alchemically
  - convert 2 litres of 5 litres of blood into poison.
  - the mixture can seep into the quiver, too
  - mechanically, how to do this ... compete with planar warrior
  - Carlos: antipoison (from anti-matter force) might heal somebody!

## fully at the morning

- goodberries go bad; distributed to needy gnolls
- Carlos wants to examine the fungal wounds -- like a doctor
  - **Tea tree oil** preparations were tested in four randomized clinical trials and some positive outcomes were attributed to the intervention in all trials. **Solanum species** (Solanine) (two trials) and **oil of bitter orange** preparations (one trial) were compared with conventional treatments. In all cases encouraging results were reported. There are few controlled clinical trials of herbal antifungal medicines. The most thoroughly clinically tested is tea tree oil, which holds some promise. All herbal remedies require further investigation in rigorous clinical trials.

## peryton

- body of gnolledge on the ground
- hill all of a sudden moves, and opens up into two massive brown wings; hideous face on this giant bird; head is that of a giant wolf with a bird beak at the end; gigantic stag antlers coming out of its head; takes off into the air silently; goes soaring over the top of you.
- headed southeast.

Calliope "casts" Warp Shadow by flying over them

- Is it fleeing?
- DM: it looks like it's flying -- you can't tell by its body language why it's leaving
- when its shadow covers you; you feel an ice cold shiver go through your body
- it doesn't have any permanent effect, but you feel immensely affected by this thing
- thaz: did you feel that? something terrible has just happened to us.
  - rushes forward to the gnoll on the ground
  - gnoll has had heart ripped out of its chest: this is Andak, this was Mezlar's brother.
  - gnolls have prison-gem hearts.
- get back into town around when everyone else is waking up.
- Mezlar: my brother! this is getting worse;
  - started a few months ago; once a month; then once a week; a day; two a day
- Carlos: is the bird getting bigger? because ... Brak? had seen it.
- Mezlar: I guess she'd never seen it up close
  - did you see ... it kill the gnoll? how did you escape?
  - [ Brak ? had said that it was a vulture eating gnoll hearts, session 4]
- Mezlar: in Thaz we were losing one of stealthiest and best fighters
  - my brother was something of a klutz; not that he in any way deserved this; I also wonder what he was doing out in the early morning like that.
  - did you see anything around him ?
  - perhaps it's time we set out to deal with it

## carlos medicine check

- on the gnolls that have vegetation growing out of them
- nurse gnoll that was injured is still in the camp; Eyeth
  - flesh is necrotic; in necrosis are growing these pretty blue flowers; bluebells
  - flowers clustered towards center of wound, and the necrosis spreading outwards
- medical or magical problem: definitely a magical problem
  - where the bluebells are growing; the nurse's flesh is pale white roots holding their flesh together
  - with palpation, those areas are totally numb; and she can't move the areas underneath
- Bluebell woods
  - 200 miles away, north-east on the coast
  - forest grew in the pattern of the wounds
  - close to coast, so could take a boat
  - still expanding
  - sightings of satyrs, dryads, or druids growing these flowers from them, but not reported on humanoids / mortals
- paros learned about sub-group of the ^[urush mekh is an inline note]
- Drav: (where did Drav learn this? someone's elders -- oh, the Flowerfolk) learned that archaeologist (Arlan Lubbock) claimed that he'd spoken to Mogesh and that Mogesh said that it could feel Baphomet trying to influence the area. Lubbock Pikkumainen (little worldly one)

- giving information about flowerfolk and amber ghost pits
- the peryton is a monstrosity
- 'roc' was as close as flick might have been able to tell

  - gigantic flying creatures.
  - wolf head with bird beak, bird body, stag antlers with sharp razor claws

- Thaz: are you referring to the _dravitas_ ?
  - they had continued to be discovered until yesterday. knowing what you told us about killing kolmy, it would be hard to tell if she was doing it, because her effects on the area couldn't be determined for a few days.

> i'm typing a lot as flick talks; probably to drav ?

- Flick, when the shadow came over you; it didn't have a bird's shadow
- Carlos: I can make it rain in a 30ft cube

they're talking about getting the oil off the bird's wings so it can't fly, like with soap; making soap from fat and lye

> fiora_the_dragon: what about making soap the old fashioned way from tallow
> fiora_the_dragon: kill many animals
> The Fun Paladin: Could we use soapberries?
> The Fun Paladin: that's a thing, right?

- the gnolls could just help you make lye
-

> Eldritch Mourning Dove (fez)
