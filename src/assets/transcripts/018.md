## flick knew a druid

- odd man she encountered. was never good at camping or learning about nature.
- saw him pretty regularly and he was willing to answer my questions
- name was Onfalon, hung out in the forest, and loved communing with animals, and he could speak through the eyes of the eagles.
- really thick dreadlocks
- never saw him actually do magic; played it close to the vest
- was doing close-up work with nature itself
- he told you about strange group of druids who pledged themselves to fungus; obsessed with the ways fungus would feed on dead material and create their own warped version of life; and how they were closer to animals than plants

  - described harnessing the powers of the fungus to create a shell around themselves, and wildshape into this; now you're thinking back, this must be what she was doing

- joan feels coin spinning above her head and juniper keeps it spinning when joan realizes to shoot lightning in particular way

  - joan can work on diagram support to be able to shoot lightning better from crouching position
  - joan really understands lightning
  - blasts them out of the way with her lightning

- flick is blowing holes in her with force arrows
- **damage per minute dropped precipitously**
- beautiful raspberries start growing out of all solraks' tattoos
- carlos: gross, flick and thaz. (bigotted). nothing wrong with gnolls. elves and procreating are the issues.
- thaz knew that she and flick had something
- grenlich: nothing but death, procreation, eating, growing from things
- fez tries to see if he can feel the ... disease.
  - fez's healing is like a power recharging station rather than anything that gets him up to full
- violet fungus rollypolly rolls around to solrak
- drav does a shit-ton of fire damage
- resistance to gas spores exploding
- solrak hits a bunch
- hits solrak for 31 damage - fungal goo
- grenlich lays out her philosophy
- thaz thinks kolmy has some points
  - flick: they would miss you too much
- joan attacks
  - "not that i like murder"; "i don't actually want anyone to be murdered"
- mass healing word
- solrak: what appeared to you while you were unconscious ?
- flick finishes Kolmy
- what really killed her is that she realized she couldn't eat the turtle, since it was a spiritual animal
- drav casts thunderwave
- curculio shakes her body and she wins her wisdom check or whatver; shakes the mushrooms off her
- solrak asks thak why she was dismissed; killed someone in a dual; in a moment of fury i killed them
  - they said i had done something to ruin their bows and committing some sort of sorcery against their house so their vegetables wouldn't grow
  - solrak: was it true?
    - fez: obviously not, that's the purpose of a dual
    - thaz: and because it was about growing, one other reason to approach kolmy
- joan wants to attack her
- little fungi are still attacking
- they try to kill the rest of the fungus
- curculio: you're a sea creature. scales, smell like fish.
- joan really wants thaz to be scared
  - joan eats the necrotic mushrooms
- thaz: why did you have to kill her
- joan wearing curculio like a mink scarf
  - thaz: pees herself; "i feel a disturbance in the strength of this glen"; she marks the territory aroundn kolmy, and one of her paws is trembling a little bit
- flick goes to shoot the gas spore
- flick examines kolmy: same centipede form
  - flick almost misses in slapping
- thaz: "you mean, following my GF and trying to make an alternative way of life"; "also solrak opened up to me
- flick: i'm sorry you felt like following this thing was the only alternative
- thaz: you have to support who you love when they go through transitions
- flick: i don't have a lot to say about that in terms of personal experience
- joan tries to muzzle curculio
- thaz: if you think you can act as emissaries for me
  - i guess i was wrong to cast you out of my heart just a moment ago
- flick: i don't take it personally
